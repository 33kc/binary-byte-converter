this program translates binary code into readable English Language.<br><br>

how this works - <br>
1. break the binary code into segments, usually grouped in 8 bits (1 byte) necessary for representing the ASCII value <br>
2. convert the 8 bits into their decimal format <br>
3. map each decimal value for the corresponding ASCII value <br>

(this made my job easy - thanks to bitset library)<br>
next commit will probably be translations between both
